# UbuntuSetup

## **Manual Steps**

Unfortunately, you have to do some manual steps to get all the system setupped.

### **Enable Extensions**
The script should have installed *Extension Manager*, so open it and click on the "Browse" tab. Then search for "UserThemes" and install it. Additionally we recommand to instal also the two exstensions "Dash To Dock" and "Dash To Dock Animator".

### **Select Themes**

This step can be skipped since is performed by the script, however if you don't like the themes installed, you can manually change them through this step. Open *Gnome Tweaks* and select from the left menu: "Appearance". 
Now you can select the theme for each element in the list:
- Applications: Folder /usr/share/themes
- Cursor: /usr/share/icons
- Icons: /usr/share/icons
- Shell: /usr/share/themes (if you cannot edit this field, be sure that all the previous steps have been followed!)
