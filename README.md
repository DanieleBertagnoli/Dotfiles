# Linux Dotfiles üêß
These are my personal dotfiles for setting up fastly my systems after a fresh installation. In each distribution's folder a `install.sh` file is available, these are designed to guide you step-by-step during the installation as some manual steps may be required. These dotfiles are useful to install quickly some essential programs and themes to make your system prettier.

Please feel free to open issues or contact me to discuss about possible bugs, problems or improvements. 

## Ubuntu dotfiles
These dotfiles are used to set up Ubuntu systems (you can slightly modify some commands to adapt it to any Debian-based distribution). 

### **Select Themes**

This step can be skipped since is performed by the script, however if you don't like the themes installed, you can manually change them through this step. Open *Gnome Tweaks* and select from the left menu: "Appearance". 
Now you can select the theme for each element in the list:
- Applications: Folder /usr/share/themes
- Cursor: /usr/share/icons
- Icons: /usr/share/icons
- Shell: /usr/share/themes (if you cannot edit this field, be sure that all the previous steps have been followed!)
